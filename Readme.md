## Demo

This app is primarily designed for native desktop platforms, and its
WebAssembly (wasm) target has a limited feature set. wasm target is best
suited for quick document sharing, currently, only WebGPU backend enabled for the demo:

  [<https://staffengineer.github.io/velo?document=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/StaffEngineer/bf7d94759abbd7aa722330e5fe4f0bd5/raw/e817be0ba700e94be472d435638d762b9deadf33/velo.json>](https://staffengineer.github.io/velo?document=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/StaffEngineer/bf7d94759abbd7aa722330e5fe4f0bd5/raw/e817be0ba700e94be472d435638d762b9deadf33/velo.json)

## What\'s implemented:
-   support rectangle/circle/paperlike notes
-   add/remove note
-   note resizing
-   note repositioning
-   wrapped text inside notes
-   paste screenshot from clipboard [native target only üñ•Ô∏è] 
-   connect notes with arrows
-   make app snapshot in memory and load from it (MacOs: Command + s\[l\])
-   save app state to database and load from it
-   change background color of notes
-   move note to front/back
-   positioning text inside note
-   multiple documents/tabs support
-   load app state from url
-   ability to create sharable url of the document using \"Share
    Document\" button (**.velo.toml** should be created in user's home
    directory containing GitHub access token with \"gist\" scope) [native target only üñ•Ô∏è]:

   ```toml
   github_access_token = "<github_access_token>"
   ```

- initial markdown support
  - italic/bold text style
  - links
  - syntax highlighting
  - headings (proper headings support was temporarily removed)
  - inline code
  - ordered/unordered lists
- particles effect [native target only üñ•Ô∏è]
- filter documents by text in notes (fuzzy search) [native target only üñ•Ô∏è]
- highlight notes containing searched text [native target only üñ•Ô∏è]
- ligature/emoji rendering support [emoji native target only üñ•Ô∏è]
- dark/light theme support (app restart is required for now)
- infinite canvas with zooming (right click to move camera, mouse wheel to zoom)
- undo/redo for text editing [native target only üñ•Ô∏è]
- drawing mode (click on pencil icon to enable it)
- draw line, arrow, rhombus or rectangle by choosing 2 points
- hide/show children notes for selected note

## Installation

[Archives of precompiled binaries for *velo* are available for Windows, macOS
and Linux.](https://github.com/StaffEngineer/velo/releases/latest)

### Compiling from Source

If you want to compile from source you can use 
```sh
cargo install --path .
```

**ATTENTION**
If you have set your cargo target directory in `.cargo/config.toml` you must provide the fullpath to the assets directory like this
```sh
BEVY_ASSET_PATH=$(realpath assets) cargo install --path .
```

## Run

Native:

```sh
cargo r --release
```

Wasm:

```sh
cargo install wasm-server-runner
RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis cargo r --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

To create app bundle with icon (tested only on MacOS):

```sh
cargo install cargo-bundle
cargo bundle
```

## Pre-commit actions

```sh
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -A clippy::type_complexity -A clippy::too_many_arguments
```

## Basic usage

- click on rectangle icon to create rectangle note
- double-click to select note
- start typing to add text to selected note
- resize note by dragging its corners
- click on canvas to deselect note
- move note by dragging it (only unselected note can be dragged to allow mouse text selection for selected note)
- click on little arrow connector icon to connect notes, arrow connector icons are placed on each side of note
- for native target there is search box that allows to filter documents by text in notes (fuzzy search)
- for wasm target there is url query parameter `?document=<url>` to load document from url
- click save icon to save document to database on native platform or to localStorage on wasm target
- click on drawing pencil to enable drawing mode

## Troubleshooting

If the application fails to start, you can try resolving the issue by removing velo data folder. This problem may occur due to changes in the data schema between different versions of the application.

- MacOS: `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/velo`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\velo`
- Linux: `/home/<username>/.config/velo`
- wasm: `localStorage.clear()`
