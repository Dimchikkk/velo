** Inspiration
I use lucid.app at work quite often to brainstorm ideas with colleagues or even solo.
I often share my ideas via sharing lucid.app diagrams or just screenshot of it. I don't use banch of features there. 
Just simple rectangles, arrows, why not build rust analog of it for the sake of learning rust and having some *fun*?

** What's implemented
✅ add/remove rectangle  
✅ rectangle resizing  
✅ rectangles repositioning  
✅ text inside rectangles  
✅ paste screenshot from clipboard  
✅ connect nodes with arrows  
✅ make game snapshot in memory and load from it (command + s|l)   
✅ save game state to file and load from it (command + shift + s|l)  
✅ change background color of rectangle  
[ ] tag/untag nodes  
[ ] move rectangle to front/back  
[ ] load from folder (switch between files)  
[ ] search by text/tag  

** Run (supported platforms: linux, macos, windows)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r 
#+END_SRC

Wasm minimal support:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
wasm-server-runner  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/ichart.wasm
#+END_SRC

** Pre-commit actions

#+BEGIN_SRC
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --fix --allow-staged -- -A clippy::type_complexity
#+END_SRC

* Tasks to todo
- Add app icon (make sure that it's embedded in release binary)
- Make text inside rectangle smart wrapping (see )
- Improve text inside rectangle:
    + text position
    + smart wrapping (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/7761)
    + text selection
    + links support
- Have two arrow mods: direct and parallel arrows (see how parrallel arrows drawn in lucid.app)
- Exectuble code inside rectangle (wasm?)
- Org support in rectangles
