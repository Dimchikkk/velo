** Demo

This app is primarily designed for native desktop platforms, and its WebAssembly (wasm) target has a limited feature set. wasm target is best suited for quick document sharing and editing, currently only landscape mode is supported (tested on Chrome):

** Inspiration  
At work, I frequently rely on lucid.app to brainstorm ideas with my colleagues or by myself. Typically, I share my ideas by sending either the diagrams themselves or screenshots of them. While I tend to stick with simple features like rectangles and arrows, I've been contemplating the idea of creating a similar tool in Rust. Not only would it allow me to learn the language, but it would also be an enjoyable project to work on.

** What's implemented:
- add/remove rectangle  
- rectangle resizing  
- rectangle repositioning  
- wrapped text inside rectangles  
- paste screenshot from clipboard  
- connect nodes with arrows  
- make app snapshot in memory and load from it (command + s[l])   
- save app state to db and load from it
- change background color of rectangle  
- move rectangle to front/back  
- positioning text in rectangle
- buttons to cut/copy/paste text in rectangle and open all links in rectangle
- tabs support
- documents support
- load app state from url

** Run

Native:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r 
#+END_SRC

Wasm:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
#+END_SRC

** Pre-commit actions

#+BEGIN_SRC
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --fix --allow-staged -- -A clippy::type_complexity -A clippy::too_many_arguments
#+END_SRC
