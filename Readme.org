** Inspiration
I use lucid.app at work quite often to brainstorm ideas with colleagues or even solo.
I often share my ideas via sharing lucid.app diagrams or just screenshot of it. I don't use banch of features there. 
Just simple rectangles, arrows, why not build rust analog of it for the sake of learning rust and having some *fun*?

** What's implemented
- ✅ add/remove rectangle  
- ✅ rectangle resizing  
- ✅ rectangle repositioning  
- ✅ text inside rectangles  
- ✅ paste screenshot from clipboard  
- ✅ connect nodes with arrows  
- ✅ make game snapshot in memory and load from it (command + s|l)   
- ✅ save game state to file and load from it (command + shift + s|l)  
- ✅ change background color of rectangle  
- ✅ move rectangle to front/back  
- ✅ positioning text in rectangle
- ✅ introduce tabs 

** Run (supported platforms: linux, macos, windows)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r

#+END_SRC

** Pre-commit actions

#+BEGIN_SRC
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --fix --allow-staged -- -A clippy::type_complexity
#+END_SRC
