** Inspiration
I use lucid.app at work quite often to brainstorm ideas with colleagues or even solo.
I often share my ideas via sharing lucid.app diagrams or just screenshot of it. I don't use banch of features there. 
Just simple rectangles, arrows, why not build rust analog of it for the sake of learning rust and having some *fun*?

** What's implemented
- ability to add rectangle
- ability to re-size rectangle
- ability to move rectangles
- ability to type text in rectangles
- ability to paste screenshot from clipboard
- ability to connect nodes with arrows
- ability to make game snapshot in memory and load from it (command + s|l)
- ability to save game state to file and load from it (command + shift + s|l)

** Run (supported platforms: linux, macos, windows)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r 
#+END_SRC

Wasm minimal support:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
wasm-server-runner  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/ichart.wasm
#+END_SRC

** Pre-commit actions

#+BEGIN_SRC
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --fix --allow-staged -- -A clippy::type_complexity
#+END_SRC

* Tasks to todo
- Add app icon (make sure that it's embedded in release binary)
- Make text inside rectangle smart wrapping (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/7761)
- Tag systems for nodes
- Add text selection inside rectangle
- Text position inside rectangles
- Links support inside rectangles
- Add button to change z-index of rectangle
- Have color pallete to change background color of rectangle
- Have two arrow mods: direct and parallel (see lucid.app) 
- Tabs of saved files
- Search system (tag and by text)
- Wasm executable code in rectangle
- Org support in rectangles
