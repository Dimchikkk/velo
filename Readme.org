* I(nteractive)Chart

[[file:ichart.gif]]

** Inspiration
I use lucid.app at work quite often to brainstorm ideas with colleagues or even solo.
I often share my ideas via sharing lucid.app diagrams or just screenshot of it. I don't use banch of features there. 
Just simple rectangles, arrows, why not build rust analog of it for the sake of learning rust and having some *fun*?

** What's implemented
- ability to add rectangle
- ability to re-size rectangle
- ability to move rectangles
- ability to type text in rectangles
- ability to paste screenshot from clipboard

** Run native

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r 
#+END_SRC

** Run web

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
wasm-server-runner  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/ichart.wasm
#+END_SRC
