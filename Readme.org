* /Rust/ icify

[[file:rusticify.gif]]

** Inspiration
I use lucid.app at work quite often to brainstorm ideas with colleagues or even solo.
I often share the ideas via sharing lucid.app diagrams or just screenshot of it. I don't use banch of features there. 
Just simple rectangles, arrows, why not build something similiar in rust, for the sake of learning rust and having some *fun*?

** What's implemented:
- add/remove rectangle  
- rectangle resizing  
- rectangle repositioning  
- wrapped text inside rectangles  
- paste screenshot from clipboard  
- connect nodes with arrows  
- make app snapshot in memory and load from it (command + s[l])   
- save app state to file and load from it (command + shift + s[l] or Save[Load] button) 
- change background color of rectangle  
- move rectangle to front/back  
- positioning text in rectangle
- introduce tabs
- buttons to cut/copy/paste text in rectangle and open all links in rectangle

** Run

Tested only on MacOS, should work on Linux and Windows as well
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r 
#+END_SRC

It runs on wasm as well, but it's not very useful, since it doesn't have clipboard/file system features, also only landscape mode is supported.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo r --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
wasm-server-runner  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/rusticify.wasm
#+END_SRC

** Pre-commit actions

#+BEGIN_SRC
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --fix --allow-staged -- -A clippy::type_complexity
#+END_SRC
